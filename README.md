# RT_V1
My first ray-tracer project.  
***
### Task:

Your goal is to be able, with the help of your program, to generate images according to  
Raytracing protocol.  
Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific  
angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting  
system.  
• Implement the Ray-Tracing method to create a computer generated image.  
• You need at least 4 simple geometric objects as a base (not composed): plane,  
sphere, cylinder and cone.  
• Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to  
objects before displaying them. For example a sphere declared at (0, 0, 0) must  
be able to successfully translate to (42, 42, 42).  
• Manage the redraw view without recalculating (basically with MinilibX, you can  
manage the expose properly): if a part of the window needs to be redrawn, it is  
best if you don’t have to recalculate everything.  
• Position and direction of any point of vision and of simple objects.  
• Smallest light management : different brightness, shadows.  
For the defence, it would be ideal for you to have a whole set of scenes with the focus  
on what is functional, facilitating that way the control of the elements to create.

Don't forget about the norm for your code. Read the norme.en.pdf file.
